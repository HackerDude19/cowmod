# Introduction
This is the source code for my minecraft mod "cowmod" avaliable on modrinth!

# Installation
Instructions:
1. Install Forge 1.20.1 (make sure minecraft launcher is NOT running)
2. Download the mod at https://modrinth.com/mod/cowmod
3. Go to your Minecraft installation folder (if you haven't changed the location, it should be located at "C:\Users\(username)\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft").
If you don't see the appdata folder, you may need to enable hidden folders. To do this, in Windows 11, underneath the adress bar, press "view", and select "show", then select "Hidden Items".
4. Drag the mod into the "mods" folder
If you do not see a "mods" folder, create one, all lowercase, or, you can launch the game using the forge installation.
5. You are done! Open the minecraft launcher, choose Forge, and press play!
